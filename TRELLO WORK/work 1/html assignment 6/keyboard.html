  <h2>Keyboard</h2>
  
  <p>The keyboard is the piece of computer hardware used to input text, characters, and other commands into a computer or similar device.Even though the keyboard is an external peripheral device in a desktop system (it sits outside the main computer housing), or is "virtual" in a tablet PC, it is an essential part of the complete computer system.
    
    Microsoft and Logitech are some of the most popular physical keyboard manufacturers, but many other hardware makers also produce them.Modern computer keyboards were modeled after, and are still very similar to, classic typewriter keyboards. Many keyboard layouts are available around the world (like Dvorak and JCUKEN) but most English language keyboards are of the QWERTY type. Other languages have different default formats, such as QWERTZ for German and AZERT for French.

    Most keyboards have numbers, letters, symbols, arrow keys, etc., but some also have a numeric keypad, additional functions like volume control, buttons to power down or sleep the device, dedicated programmable shortcut keys, keys that light up when pressed, or even a built-in trackball mouse that's intended to provide an easy way to use.</p>

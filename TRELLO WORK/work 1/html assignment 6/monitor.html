  <h2>Monitor</h2>
  
  <p>
    A monitor is a piece of computer hardware that displays the video and graphics information generated by a connected computer through the computer's video card.

    Monitors are similar to TVs but usually display information at a much higher resolution. Also unlike televisions, monitors typically sit atop a desk rather than being mounted on a wall. A monitor is sometimes referred to as a screen, display, video display, video display terminal, video display unit, or video screen.
    
    Because there are so many different types of monitors and ways to use them, we've gathered together articles that can help you wade through everything. To use the guide, open the links in the navigation bar and click links on the individual articles that interest you. The guide is divided into five sections: Monitor Basics, Add or Connect a Monitor, Calibrate It Yourself, Troubleshooting Issues, and Our Recommendations: Best Monitors.

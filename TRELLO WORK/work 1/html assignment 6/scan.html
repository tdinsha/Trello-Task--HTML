  <h2>Scanner</h2>
  
  <p>A scanner is an electrical device that reads and converts documents such as photos and pages of text into a digital signal. This changes the documents in a form that can be viewed and or modified on a computer system by using software applications. There are numerous kinds of scanners available in the market that have different resolutions.

    Most scanners have a flat scanning surface as they are flatbed devices, which are mainly used for scanning magazines, photographs, and numerous documents. Furthermore, because most flatbed scanners have a cover that lifts up, they can scan books and other heavy things. A sheet-fed scanner is another type of scanner that is only able to accept paper documents. Although sheet-fed scanners have no capability of scanning books, some of their models include a feature of an automatic document feeder (ADF) that allows various pages to be scanned in sequence.
    
    The scanner interacts with computer software applications to execute tasks. The data from the scanner is imported into these apps. Most of the scanners contain basic scanning software that makes users capable of configuring, initiating, and importing scans.
    
    Although some programs like OmniPage and Acrobat can identify scanned text, the scanned images can also be edited by Photoshop. </p>

  <h2>Mouse</h2>
  
  <p>The mouse, sometimes called a pointer, is a hand-operated input device used to manipulate objects on a computer screen.

    Whether it uses a laser or ball, or the mouse is wired or wireless, a movement detected from the mouse sends instructions to the computer to move the cursor on the screen in order to interact with files, windows, and other software elements.
    
    Even though the mouse is a peripheral device that sits outside the main computer housing, it's an essential piece of computer hardware in most systems...at least non-touch ones
    Computer mice come in many shapes and sizes but are all designed to fit either the left or right hand, and be used on a flat surface.

    The standard mouse has two buttons toward the front (to left-click and right-click) and a scroll wheel in the center (to quickly move the screen up and down). However, a computer mouse can have anywhere from one to several more buttons to provide a wide variety of other functions (like the 12-button Razer Naga Chroma MMO Gaming Mouse).</p>

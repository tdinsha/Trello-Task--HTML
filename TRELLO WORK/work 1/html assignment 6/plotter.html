  <h2>Plotter</h2>
  
  <p>A plotter is a type of printer that prints vector graphics. It is a piece of computer gear that converts computer commands into paper line drawings. It draws a line with one or more automatic pens. Unlike a traditional printer, a plotter uses a pen, marker, pencil, or other writing tools to draw multiple rather than toner. It may also use vector graphics files or commands to draw continuous point-to-point lines. Though it was previously widely used for computer-aided design, it is now only used to print hard copies of schematics and other comparable application.In engineering projects, plotters are widely used. Because they have the ability to draw continuous lines, whereas ordinary printers use closely spaced dots to conventionally drew lines. Plotters are designed in different forms, and they use different-different tools to draw lines on the paper. For example, a 3-D plotter (cutting plotter) uses knives to design any type of diagram or cut out a piece of material on the basis of given inputs from the computer. On the other hand, most of the plotters use a pen to draw lines on the paper.

    The object that is to be cut is located on the flat surface in front of the plotter. The computer forwards cutting design and dimensions to the plotter for producing an exactly carved design. Then, repeat the cutting process on hundreds of objects to produce identical copies of the same designs.</p>
